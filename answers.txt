What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A merge is the combination of changes from one branch onto another branch.
A rebase is a movement of changes from one branch onto another branch. 
Basically, merge connects two branches, whilst rebase takes one branch
and puts it ontop of another branch creating one branch with a re-written
history.
